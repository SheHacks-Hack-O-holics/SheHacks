**About :**
As a helping hand to the farmers, “Rooted” is a web portal facilitating direct contact between farmer(producer) and customers(buyer) with elimination of the middle-men to maximize the profit earned by farmers and provide farm-products to customers at fair price. This will also benefit local transportation projects for the delivery and shipping purposes.

**Working :**
Rooted has a simple and user-friendly interface with simple click-on buttons and forms. Registration is the first step for signing in the web portal for Farmers with a simple form with their Aadhar card number for verification of farmers and prevention of fake sellers. For customers(buyers) simple form is provided for registration to fill in their details including Home Address for product delivery purpose. Details filled in will directly be stored into the Database (Google Sheets).
With the help of data visualization the buyers can go through the different rates of a product through different sellers and make the best choice of their desired product. The graph gives you the total overview of difference in rates of products of other portals and Rooted. The cart is available for the buyers to add all the items and make a buy all at once. Three payment options are made available to the buyers.
Financial Aid :
1. The payment done by seller will be returned to farmer after a week and meanwhile the amount will be issued to official Rooted bank account for interest
2. Google advertisements will be used
3. According to the policy of Rooted, we can collaborate with other projects having similar purpose (not the exact same)
Add-Ons In The Near Future :
1.	Sharing live delivery tracking updates to the customers
2.	Use of different languages to make the portal more user-friendly
3.	Live Data visualization model with the fluctuations of daily market rate
4.  Personalized auto-recommendation on the basis of previous orders

Rooted – is a website created in interest of those underprivileged farmers. It provides them a platform to sell their goods at a reasonable rate. Also it helps the customers to gain resources at a good rate.
